# 1st_Year_HardwareProject_Detect_People-Covid_Janitor

# Description

I successfully completed a hardware project called Covid Janitor, a robot designed to fight against COVID-19. The robot can move, measure body temperature, detect people, sanitize hands, and clean spaces. It helps to detect cases, maintain hygiene, and minimize the spread of the virus. I received a high grade for this project, which is a testament to my technical expertise and commitment to improving the user experience of Covid Janitor.
